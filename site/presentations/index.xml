      <description>Like all things Web, SEO is a wild ride. Ranking criteria changes rapidly as do strategies for optimizing content visibility.

Schema.org is a collaborative effort founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. Its purpose is to create, maintain, and promote structured data schemas for embedding a voculary of metadata into Web markup.</description>

      <description>The static website has been reborn! Using a static site generator can simplify website production, optimize performance, and improve security. By streamlining the production process, static site generators can make more time for creating content instead of maintaining the plumbing that delivers it.  Written in Go, the Hugo static site generator (SSG) is very fast and built for performance. What also makes it stand out is an extremely powerful, flexible content model.</description>

      <title>Ridiculously Easy Layouts with Flexbox</title>
      <link>http://www.ericcarlisle.com/presentations/2016/03/10/ridiculously-easy-layouts-flexbox/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
    Ready to have your mind blown? Meet Flexbox! The Flexbox (or Flexible Box) Layout Model is a set of CSS attributes that will likely change the way you think about UI layouts. Flexbox uses a dual-axis, container/item layout model allowing for powerful approaches to element space distribution, alignment, and sizing. This can be a tremendous boon for web projects with dynamic data and design flux. It may also tremendously simplify responsive layouts that are dependent on commonly complicated grid models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    This presentation will introduce the mechanics of the Flexible Box Model and demonstrate its capability for simplifying markup and styling. Comparisons will be made to other layout paradigms to illustrate strengths of the model.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In only the last few years, Responsive Design patterns and paradigms have brought forth spectacular, sweeping changes in UI web production. The demands for device-compliance as well as the always-growing mobile market have made Responsive Design a necessity for many websites and web applications. While taking the Responsive approach may offer incredible opportunities, it also carries a gamut of challenges.

      <title>Dazzling Data Depiction with D3.js</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating data visualizations for a web has historically been a daunting task. Due to a lacking standards of browser-supported visualization, often the most approachable solutions would involve proprietary platforms, 3rd-party services, browser plugins, or just static imagery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The D3.js JavaScript library uses HTML, CSS, and SVG for binding data to web documents. This standards-based approach allows visualizations to be created across browsers without the need for 3rd-party tooling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Yin and Yang of Responsive Workflow</title>
      <link>http://www.ericcarlisle.com/presentations/2013/06/19/yin-yang-responsive-workflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://www.ericcarlisle.com/presentations/2013/06/19/yin-yang-responsive-workflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive Design&lt;/strong&gt; has revolutionized the way we create websites, yet there is a strong tendency to still use traditional workflow methodologies. Such workflows can make a project far less efficient while adding a gamut of risks. This session will explore this dilemma, propose alternate workflows for responsive website projects, and offer respective approaches and tooling options for both designers and developers.
